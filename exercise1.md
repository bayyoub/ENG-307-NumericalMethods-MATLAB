# Writing and Running MATLAB Scripts

This segment introduces basic MATLAB scripting. It covers variable assignment, performing operations (e.g., addition), and displaying results using the `disp` function. This is a foundational exercise to familiarize students with MATLAB syntax and simple calculations.

### Initialize variables

```matlab
a = 10; % Assign the value 10 to variable 'a'
b = 20; % Assign the value 20 to variable 'b'
```
### Perform calculation

```matlab
c = a + b; % Add variables 'a' and 'b' and store the result in 'c'
```

test

### Display the result

```matlab
disp(c) % Output the value of 'c' to the command window
```
