# Example Function: Squaring a Number

This example demonstrates a simple MATLAB function, my_fxn, which takes a numerical input and returns its square. The function is structured with clear comments explaining the input, output, and the function's purpose. Students can use this as a basic template for writing and understanding MATLAB functions.

## MATLAB Function
```matlab
function output = my_fxn(input)
output = (input)^2; % Squaring the input and assigning to output
end % End of the function
```

#### Comments:
- `function output = my_fxn(input)`: Defines the function named `my_fxn` that takes `input` as an argument and returns `output`.
- `output = (input)^2`: Squares the `input` value and stores the result in `output`.
- `end`: Marks the end of the function.
