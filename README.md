# ENG-307 Applied Numerical Methods & Programming in Engineering: Supplementary MATLAB Practice Scripts

This page provides supplementary examples for students to explore and experiment with. These examples are simple and designed to help you better understand various MATLAB statements, loops, and operations. You can copy and paste the code into MATLAB to see how each part works.

These examples should not be considered your primary source of learning but rather as additional resources to support what we cover in class. Some examples may be reviewed during lessons, while others are here to help reinforce key concepts through hands-on practice.

Each practice script can be found in the links below:
